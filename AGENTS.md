# Instructions for AI Agents

## Overview

This repository drives continuous Jepsen tests for new RabbitMQ releases.

## Workflows

The workflows under `.github/workflows` are structured like so:

 * `jepsen.yml`: drives the tests
 
These workflows are triggered externally from [`rabbitmq/server-packages`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/server-packages).

## Comments

 * Never mention yourself in commit messages in any way (no "Generated by", no AI tool links, etc)

## Style Guide
